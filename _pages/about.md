I'm The_Martyr, an undergraduate student interested in artificial intelligence. This is my second year interning at AIMlab. I am seeking a remote summer research opportunity for the summer of 2024 in a direction that encompasses MLLM/LLM, XAI, and and other related tasks (I am ready to try new research directions). If interested, feel free to drop me an email!😄
